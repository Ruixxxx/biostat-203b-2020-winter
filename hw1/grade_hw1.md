-   Q1 (10/10)

-   Q2 (18/20)

    \#4. (-2 pts) Your solution counts the number of occurrences of the word `HISPANIC` in the file. But the question asks for the number of **unique** Hispanic patients. Count the number of Hispanic patients with unique `SUBJECT_ID`.

### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch? 

    Yes. 

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear?

    12 commits for hw1. **Make sure** to start version control from the very beginning of a project. Make as many commits as possible during the process. Make comments more informative.

	  Yes. 
	  
### Reproducibility: 10/10

    Yes.
